**Python assignments**


**Question-1 ( calendar module )**

Date is given as input and output needs to be only day of given date in capitalized.

     •	Imported logging for using Info, warning logs and assigned a file path.
     •	Created a function for calendar module.
     •	Received the date as input and assigned it to day, month, and year.
     •	Used calender.weekday function to get week day.
     •	And converted as capitalized and printed output, called funtion in driver file.
     •	Verified  the actual input with expected output is passed in testcase file.

**Question-2 ( Floor, ceil, rint )**

Task is to print the floor, ceil, and rint values from the array given.

     •	Defined a list and received the values by split function.
     •	Converted list to array.
     •	Used logging for information log.
     •	Defined a individual  functions to get the floor, ceil, rint values.
     •	Called the function in driver file.
     •	Received the expected output and test cases passed

**Question-3 (Linear algebra)**

Given a square matrix  with dimensions n X n. need to find the determinant value as round value.

     •	Defined a linear algebra method as linear_alg().
     •	Declared an array and received the n values to get the array data.
     •	Appended values to the array using loops.
     •	Converted the array to matrix using matrix().
     •	Determined value is received by linalg.det().
     •	Made round value with return value.
     •	Called the function in driver file.
     •	And used testcase file for verifying the test cases.
     
**Question-4 (Python List)**

Using a list (list = []). Need to perform the following commands insert, print, remove, append, sort, pop, reverse based on user options.

     •	Declared a list [ ] and received input values from user.
     •	Users option is stored in a new list.
     •	Based on option if Insert ,insert() method is used and added the values tolist.
     •	Print() method is used if print is option.
     •	To remove a particular value  remove() with index value is received.
     •	Finally list values are returned from the function.
     •	List_methods function is called in driver file.
     •	Using testcase file test cases are verified passed as expected and actual values are same.
     
**Question-5 (Marks_Percentage)**

Need to read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name:[marks] for a list of students. Print the average of the marks array for the student name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.

     •	Using input() number students records are received in a stu_marks{} dictionary.
     •	Student name and marks are received using map and assigned marks values to separate list.
     •	Student name is used as key and values are assigned as marks.
     •	Based on users option student name is received and verified.
     •	Average of total marks of particular student is calculated in average_matks().
     •	If the record is not found prints as record is not added.
     •	Average_marks() is called in driver files.
     •	And the actual values are verified with expected values in testcase file.
